## About `W0CHP-PiStar-Dash` ("WPSD")

This is my very highly modified and customized fork  of `MW0MWZ`'s Pi-Star
software, and I call it "`W0CHP-PiStar-Dash`" (abbreviated as WPSD). There are
so many large changes, divergences and new features, it merited my own
fork/version.

In fact, it’s pretty much its own distribution at this point; especially now
that the WPSD disk/OS images are now based on newer operating systems and
software.

## How to Install WPSD

For the sake of having to maintain only one authoritative document, it's all
documented here: http://wpsd.w0chp.net
